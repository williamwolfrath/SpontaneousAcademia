-- SUMMARY --

This aptly named module integrates Apache Solr with Panels. It exposes the
search form, results and information about the search as panes for use in Panels
and supporting modules. This allows for more flexible search pages and results.

For a full description of the module, visit the project page:

-- REQUIREMENTS --

Apache Solr Search Integration

Chaos tool suite

Version 3.7 of Panels is required and has to be patched (for now). See below
for more information.


-- INSTALLATION --

* Install as usual, see http://drupal.org/node/70151 for further information.


-- PATCHING PANELS --

Due to a limitation in Panels' display renderer, a patch must be applied for
this module to work. There's an issue for fixing the limitation in Panels, so
hopefully this won't be necessary soon.

* Download the patch file:
