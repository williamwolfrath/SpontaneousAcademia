        Improvements:
	  
	  * one can make a decision concerning a paper: 1. reject,
	  2. accept and 3. request a modification. The user is informed my
	  email.

	  * reminder email: reviewers can be reminded by an email.

	  * node access mechanism: if the conference chair assigned a
	  paper to a reviewer or has made a decision the corresponding
	  paper can't be edited anymore by the owner.

	  * time limit reached: if the timlimit for the call for paper is
	  reached, one needn't update the permissions to create a node of
	  the paper type (admin/access). Now the conference module inhibit
	  the creation formular.

	  * time limit exception: if the conference chair requests a
	  modification of a paper and the time limit is reached, the user
	  can still create a modified paper.

	  * modified paper: the entrys of the old paper are copied to the
	  creation formular of the new one. Works only with cck.
